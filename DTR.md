Project: Battleship

Group Member Names: Glynnis O'Connell, Jeremy Bennett

Goals and Expectations for the Project:  We want to have a working game no later than 2/8/19. Success will be measured by a working program and a passing grade on the project.

Team strengths & collaboration styles: We are going to combine our joint appreciation of constant communication, Jeremy's self-drive and Glynnis' positivity to create our game.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: To push ourselves to try anything and stay focused through positivity.

Schedule Expectations: To stay after class to work together in person, split up tasks as necessary for completion at home, and check in with each other during the half-hour to hour before class starts.

Communication Expectations: We agreed on a communications cut off time of 10 pm, and to check in at minimum daily via slack or phone.

Abilities & Growth Expectations: Our joint learning goal is to better understand how to define objects (what goes in what, why,) and how they interact.

Workload Expectations: Glynnis agreed to take a look at breaking up tasks, then come together in person during/after class to finalize our workload and flow plan.

Workflow Expectations: TBD in person.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: We both agreed that we collaborate best in person so we expect feedback to be direct and much of the work to be done in person.

Project management tools we will use: Slack, Git/GitHub

Day 1 Agenda: Complete DTR memo, create preliminary plan, review project requirements, iterations, and interaction patterns.
